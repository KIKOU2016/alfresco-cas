A sample Alfresco SDK application with CAS authentication enabled.

N.B. Note that if Alfresco is configured with external auth then you should be aware that it makes use of HTTP headers and you should take suitable steps to ensure that you are not vunerable to a header injection attack. (see platform README.md)

Use at your own risk

Please see the README.md files in the sub projects for details of how to install each component.

You do not need to install the platform/repo amp unless you want to use the Alfresco Admin Console with CAS authentication
